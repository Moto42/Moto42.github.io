"YAY. It crashed!"

So, I just spent 20 minutes hunting down a bug.

Expected behavior: Click button: Element onscreen changes.
Actual behavior: Click button: Nothing.

After some editing, googling, <del>weeping,</del> and frustration I find and correct a small mistake.

Expected behavior: Click button: Element onscreen changes.
Actual behavior: entire website crashes.
My reaction: *Celebration* (?)

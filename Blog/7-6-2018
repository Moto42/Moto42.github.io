Two weeks ago (Sun, July24,2018) I began a crash course on full-stack web development. Now I'm geting up at 4AM to study, gladly.

I'v  been circling coding of one type or another for a long time, but I never  built that interest into a usable skill. I'd have a small project here and there, find the code I needed, or learn just enough to get the job done and promptly forget about it.
I never put in the sort of consistant effort to learn a specific language, or set of languages and built that up into marketable skills; until now.

I took a semester of Webmastering back in high school.
Things have changed since '98.

So, in a little under two weeks, I've gone from 'understands a few programming and logic principles' to 'basic competence with HTML, CSS, and Javascript', and I'm pretty happy so far. There is a lot of work ahead, and I'm up for it.

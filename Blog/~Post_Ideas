my review of "The Miracle Morning"

How I use GTD

The 12 week year.

"What should I learn first".? 
	"get a crash course in full-stack web dev first. Then go hard into HTML, CSS, and javaScript"

	some guy on the interweebs proposed this..
		•HTML & CSS
		•JavaScript and one or more libraries (he proposes jQuery, I'm going with react.)
		•One server back-end Object Oriented programming language. PHP is the most common, go with that.
		•Have you heard of this thing called WordPress? Everyone else has and about a quarter of the Internet is running on it.

		


"When should I start job searching?"
	Start now fucker!

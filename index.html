			<h1>What is this?</h1>
			This is a from scratch, responsive, single-page website I'm putting together as part of my project to teach myself web developement. It's not great, but from zero to this in two weeks of studing around a full time job, I'm proud of my progress so far.

			<h1>Why Halloween?</h1>
			I enjoy fall in general, and Halloween in particular. So when I was originaly working on this I decided on a Halloween theme for the project. Later on I decided to re-use the layout for my page, and simply copied the whole thing over.

			<h1>This tells me nothing about you.</h1>
			Yea, I'm working on that. Everything you see here should be replaced with at least vaugly relavent images and information within a week or so. <br>
			If any of the images up here are yours... sorry? I'll have them down soon. It's near midnight right now though and I have <del>heat stroke</del> work in the morning.
